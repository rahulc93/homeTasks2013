My Experience in Summer Training 2013
--------------------------------------

Hello everyone.

I am Rahul Chowdhury. I am from West Bengal, India, and I am doing my B.Tech in Information Technology from National Institute of Technology, Durgapur. I love coding, and for the past few years I have been involved with it.

I am familiar with the following languages:

        1. `C`_
        #. `C++`_
        #. `Java`_
        #. `PHP`_
        #. `Python`_

I came to know about the `Summer Training`_ in `dgplug`_ from some friends of mine, and decided to try it for myself. I have been attending it for around 3 weeks now, and I must admit that it has been extremely productive.
In the training I got to learn about `FOSS`_ world and `FOSS`_ culture, had the opportunity to interact with differend personalities, get to know the basics of linux and brush up my programming skills.

What I learnt till now:

        - Communication guidelines in `FOSS`_
        - Things recquired for doing a project
        - Getting familiar with Linux, some of its basic commands
        - Using Version Control Systems, like git
        - Programming with `Python`_

I am still learning a lot, and this training is going to help me a lot in my later days as a developer and contributer.
Our mentor, *Kushal Das*, though strict and very professional, is extremely efficient in his work. Under his guidance you are bound to excel.

I can see that this summer is going to be extremely productive for me, and I am thankful to Kushal Das for that. The whole training has been a great experience for me so far. I enjoyed it totally, and learned a lot in the process. Looking forward to a great summer ahead :)
